# Asset-Centric Commerce Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive asset taxonomy system for medtech companies to support post-purchase commerce by connecting customer equipment with compatible products and parts.

## Components Created

### 1. Custom Objects

#### Asset Category (`Asset_Category__c`)

- **Purpose**: Hierarchical categorization of medical equipment
- **Key Features**:
  - Self-lookup relationship for parent-child hierarchy
  - Description field for detailed category information
  - Supports unlimited hierarchy levels (Medical > Medical Imaging > MRI, etc.)

#### Asset Type (`Asset_Type__c`)

- **Purpose**: Specific equipment models and configurations
- **Key Features**:
  - Master-Detail relationship to Asset Category
  - Model Number, Manufacturer, and Description fields
  - Represents specific equipment like "Magnetom Aera 1.5T"

#### Asset Type Product (`Asset_Type_Product__c`)

- **Purpose**: Junction object for many-to-many relationships
- **Key Features**:
  - Master-Detail to Asset Type
  - Lookup to Product2 (respects Product2 limitations)
  - Enables compatibility mapping between equipment and consumables/parts

### 2. Standard Object Extensions

#### Asset Object

- Added `Asset_Type__c` lookup field
- Links individual customer assets to their equipment type
- Enables asset-specific product recommendations
- Added `Asset_Hierarchy_Path__c` formula field for complete hierarchy visualization

#### Product2 Object

- Added `Asset_Type__c` lookup field
- Supports capital asset sales scenarios
- Maintains product-to-equipment relationships

### 3. Security & Access

#### Asset Taxonomy Manager Permission Set

- Full CRUD access to all custom objects
- Field-level security for all custom fields
- Apex class access: AssetProductController, ProductPricingService
- Intended for administrators and asset managers
- Excludes Master-Detail fields (automatically inherit permissions)

#### ACC Buyer Permission Set

- Read-only access to Asset, Asset_Category**c, Asset_Type**c, and Product2 objects
- Read access to all relevant fields for asset-centric commerce
- Apex class access: AssetProductController, ProductPricingService
- Intended for buyer users who need to browse and purchase compatible products
- Follows principle of least privilege for commerce scenarios

### 4. User Interface

#### Custom App: Asset Management

- Lightning-enabled application
- Includes tabs for all asset taxonomy objects
- Integrated with standard Asset and Product2 objects
- Provides centralized access to asset management functionality

#### Custom Tabs

- Asset Categories tab with gear icon
- Asset Types tab with hierarchy icon
- Asset Type Products tab with link icon

### 5. Apex Classes

#### AssetProductController

- **Purpose**: Controller for Asset-Product LWC components
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAccountAssets()`: Retrieves hierarchical asset tree for an account
  - `getCompatibleProductsWithStoreName()`: Gets compatible products with B2B Commerce pricing
  - `getWebstoreId()`: Resolves webstore name to ID for environment portability
- **Features**: Tree-based asset navigation, product compatibility mapping, pricing integration
- **Security**: Uses `with sharing` for proper record-level security

#### ProductPricingService

- **Purpose**: B2B Commerce pricing integration using Connect API
- **Key Features**:
  - Invocable method for Flow integration
  - Dynamic Connect API calls for B2B Commerce pricing
  - Fallback to standard pricebook when Connect API unavailable
  - Support for bulk product pricing operations
- **Integration**: Designed to work with or without B2B Commerce licensing

### 6. Hierarchy Formula Fields

#### User-Friendly Path Visualization

- **Category Hierarchy Path** (`Category_Hierarchy_Path__c`): Shows up to 5 levels of category hierarchy using ➤ arrow symbol
- **Type Hierarchy Path** (`Type_Hierarchy_Path__c`): Shows Asset Type name plus complete category hierarchy
- **Asset Hierarchy Path** (`Asset_Hierarchy_Path__c`): Shows Asset name plus complete type and category hierarchy

#### Formula Field Benefits

- **Visual Clarity**: Uses ➤ emoji arrows for clear hierarchy separation
- **List View Friendly**: Optimized for display in list views and reports
- **Clean Syntax**: Uses BLANKVALUE function for readable formula code
- **Scalable Design**: Supports up to 5 levels of hierarchy depth

#### Example Outputs

- Category: "MRI Systems ➤ Medical Imaging ➤ Medical Equipment ➤ Healthcare"
- Asset Type: "Magnetom Aera 1.5T ➤ MRI Systems ➤ Medical Imaging ➤ Medical Equipment"
- Asset: "Main Campus MRI Unit ➤ Magnetom Aera 1.5T ➤ MRI Systems ➤ Medical Imaging"

### 6. Sample Data

#### Realistic Medtech Data Structure

- **52 Asset Categories**: Hierarchical structure from Medical > Medical Imaging > specific modalities
- **12 Asset Types**: Real equipment models (Siemens Magnetom, GE Revolution CT, etc.)
- **38 Products**: Consumables, parts, and accessories
- **38 Asset Type Product relationships**: Compatibility mappings

## Data Model Architecture

```
Asset Category (Self-Lookup Hierarchy)
    ↓ Master-Detail
Asset Type (Equipment Models)
    ↓ Master-Detail
Asset Type Product ←→ Product2 (Lookup)

Asset ←→ Asset Type (Lookup)
Product2 ←→ Asset Type (Lookup)
```

## Key Business Benefits

### 1. Hierarchical Asset Organization

- Medical > Medical Imaging > MRI > Specific Models
- Supports complex equipment categorization
- Enables roll-up reporting and analytics

### 2. Product Compatibility Management

- Clear mapping between equipment and compatible products
- Supports post-purchase commerce scenarios
- Enables targeted product recommendations

### 3. Flexible Relationship Model

- Handles many-to-many relationships between assets and products
- Respects Salesforce platform limitations (Product2 constraints)
- Supports both capital asset sales and consumable/parts commerce

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Salesforce Platform Considerations

- **Product2 Limitations**: Cannot have Master-Detail relationships pointing to it
- **Master-Detail Fields**: Automatically required, don't specify in metadata
- **Permission Sets**: Master-Detail fields inherit object-level permissions

### Deployment Best Practices

- Deploy components immediately after creation for validation
- Use Salesforce deployment for XML validation vs. VS Code
- Document lessons learned for future development

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Post-Purchase Commerce

1. Customer views their installed MRI equipment
2. System shows compatible RF coils, coolant, and accessories
3. Customer adds needed items to cart
4. Streamlined purchasing of parts and consumables

### 2. Asset Management

1. Track customer equipment by specific model and type
2. Maintain hierarchical view of equipment categories
3. Generate reports on equipment utilization and needs

### 3. Product Catalog Management

1. Define which products work with which equipment
2. Manage compatibility relationships
3. Support product recommendations and cross-selling

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements

1. **Lightning Web Components**: Build custom UI for asset-product browsing
2. **Flow Automation**: Automate compatibility checking and recommendations
3. **Integration**: Connect with ERP systems for inventory and pricing

### Phase 3 Advanced Features

1. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Machine learning for product suggestions
2. **Predictive Maintenance**: Proactive parts ordering based on usage patterns
3. **Mobile Experience**: Field service and customer mobile applications

## Files Created
